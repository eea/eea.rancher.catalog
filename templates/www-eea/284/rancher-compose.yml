        Use "rancher-ebs" for best performance in Amazon.
        Anywhere else it is recommended to use "local", but you'll have to make sure that services don't spread accross multiple hosts.
        "Disable" it if you need scaling and don't need code intervention.
        You will have to use "rancher-nfs" if you need scaling and code intervention (be aware that this will have a drastic impact on performance)
